TicTacToe Game

TicTacToe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic and simple game played between two players. Here is some detailed information about the game:

Game Board :
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Each of the nine squares can hold one mark: either an 'X' or an 'O'.

Objective:
The objective is to be the first player to place three of their marks in a row.
The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

Players:
The game involves two players.
One player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'.
Players take turns placing their marks in an empty square.

Winning Conditions:
A player wins by placing three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw, also known as a cat's game.

Game Flow:
Start: The game starts with an empty grid.
Turns: Players alternate turns, starting with 'X'.
Marking: On their turn, a player places their mark in an empty square.
Checking for Win: After each turn, the game is checked for a win or a draw.
End: The game ends when a player wins or all squares are filled resulting in a draw.

Strategy Tips:
Center First: The center square is the most advantageous position, as it is part of four potential winning lines.
Corners: After the center, corners are the next most strategic spots.
Block Opponent: Always watch the opponent's moves and block their potential winning lines.
Forks: Create opportunities where you have two ways to win simultaneously, forcing your opponent to block one and allowing you to win with the other.

Variations and Complexity:
Although the standard game is simple, variations exist with larger grids or different rules, which increase complexity.
The classic 3x3 grid TicTacToe has a finite number of possible games, making it solvable and allowing for perfect play strategies to ensure a win or draw.

Computer Implementations:
Many algorithms can play TicTacToe perfectly, such as the minimax algorithm, which ensures the best possible move is made at each step.
This has led to the game being used in teaching AI concepts and game theory.

Fun Fact:
Despite its simplicity, TicTacToe has been a subject of study in combinatorial game theory, demonstrating foundational principles in the field of artificial intelligence and decision-making algorithms.

Ai player also there in this project .when your alone then you can paly for fun.
In thise project two players are there raji and Ai
u want change your name also it is  possible. 

for this code use the java ide to run it.

Thank you..
